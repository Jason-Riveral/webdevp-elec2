                    <p>CEBU CITY, Philippines –  The head of the Land Transportation Office in Central Visayas (LTO-7) has ordered an investigation into the “malicious” video that was posted by a Cebu blogger who accused their satellite office in Medellin Cebu of illegal practices.

                        In a video which he posted on his social media on Friday, August 16, a blogger named Jeomar Unabia, accused LTO Medellin of the unauthorized use of an “improvised” plate in one of their service vehicles.
                        
                        </p><br>

                    <p>LTO-7 Director Glen Galario said they will have to determine first if Unabia’s social media posts had “legal implications” before they will take legal actions against him.

                        At the same time, Galario said he will order for an internal investigation to look into Unabia’s other concerns.
                        
                        Police Major Timothy Romanillos, chief of the Medellin Police Station, said that Unabia was brought to the hospital shortly after his visit to their police station on Friday after he complained of difficulty in breathing.
                        
                        
                        
                        The next day, Unabia travelled to Cebu City and said that he will not return to Medellin without a lawyer. In a video that he posted on his social media page, he said that an LTO Medellin employee had told him that they were retired police officers.
                        
                        When he arrived at the office at past 11 a.m., he started a live broadcast and pointed at that one of the office’s service vehicles was using an improvised plate.
                        
                        He alleged that the practice of using an improvised vehicle plate was contrary to the agency’s campaign against traffic violators.
                        
                        Unabia also introduced another person, who he said was issued a citation ticket for the use of an improvised plate even if does have his driver’s license and vehicle registration.
                        
                        
                        “Sakit sa buot, naay madakpan unya pagkahuman ang nanakop [naay] improvised plate,” he said.
