                <p>Throughout the season, Vasquez's performances continued to inspire both his fellow contestants and viewers at home.</p>
                <p>In the grand finale, he delivered a powerful rendition of "A Million Dreams," capturing the song's themes of hope and ambition as he set his sights on becoming the next winner. Another standout moment was his performance of Sia's "Unstoppable," a fitting anthem that showcased his resilience and determination, having previously competed in "Tawag ng Tanghalan" in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>Jeremy Beloate secured fifth place, while Danny Joseph finished in fourth. Sydney Sterlace claimed third place, with Shye taking second in the season-long competition.</p>
                <p>The competition, determined by online votes, saw Vasquez overcome various challenges, proving time and time again that he is truly unstoppable.</p>
                <p>With his $100,000 grand prize and recording contract, the future is bright for Vasquez, whose journey on "The Voice" has proven that dreams do come true.</p>

            <p>MANILA, Philippines — The Internet is still reeling from the bombshell revelations of the alleged cheating issue involving the MaThon screen tandem of Maris Racal and Anthony Jennings.</p>
            <p>Anthony's ex, Jamela Villanueva, showed a series of screenshots and pictures last December 4, allegedly between the actor and Maris.</p>
            <p>The photos circulated online during the late hours and into the following day as the public began discussing topics like cheating, misogyny and data privacy.</p>
            <p>Lawyer Jesus Falcis, in a lengthy post on social media, detailed the legal aspects of the issue as he recalled being asked in the past about the legality of posting and sharing screenshots of private conversations.</p>
            <p>"I have always told [those who were cheated on] that there is such a thing called as the right to privacy. Even cheaters [sic] have human rights," said Falcis.</p>

            <p>MANILA, Philippines — A kissing video of actress Sunshine Cruz and businessman Atong Ang went viral on social media.</p>
            <p>In a video uploaded on TikTok, Sunshine was seen kissing Atong while in an unknown cockpit arena.</p>
            <p>It can be recalled that there's a romance rumor between Sunshine and Atong earlier this year after they were spotted together in a party.</p>
            <p>Last year, Sunshine revealed that she and partner Macky Mathay broke up.</p>
            <p>In her interview with Karen Davila, Sunshine bared the reason of their breakup.</p>
            <p>"Almost 5 days bago mag-6th anniversary kami nakipaghiwalay ako sa kanya. Lock in taping pa 'yun. Through message I said na I don't think may patutunguhan pa 'tong relationship," she said.</p>
            <p>"Nakita ko lang, Ms. Karen, na parang hindi nagle-level up 'yung relationship. Hindi nagmu-move. Don't get me wrong, he's a good guy. I love his children. Pero siyempre, at this point in my life, I am 45 parang siyempre naghahanap na tayo ng relationship na kahit papaano lume-level up. Hindi 'yung diretso lang kasi magsi-six years na. I give him a chance, no regrets naman, he was a good guy."</p>
